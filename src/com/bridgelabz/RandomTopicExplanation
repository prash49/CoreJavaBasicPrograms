1. How to create  a singleton ?
to create a singleton instance , we need to provide the instance through a static method
make constructor as private so no other class can access it, only the inside the class it'll be accessable
create a method where it call the constructor and creates a instance , so create a static class , private static constr
create a static variable where it'll return one instance of Singleton class

class Singleton{
privare static Singleton instance;
private statis Signleton(){}
public static Singleton getInstance(){
if(instance == null){
 instance = new Singleton();
}
return instance;
}
}
