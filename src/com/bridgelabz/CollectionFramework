              Collection Interface : is the root of the Java collection mostof the collections in java are inherited from this interface except
              Map


Collection has implemented and extended to List , SEt and queue

List Interface : java.util.list
1.contains ordered elements
2.may include duplicates
3.Supports indexed based search , random access

Set: java.util.set
1.doesn't define an order hence index based searching is not possible
2. duplicates are not allowed in the Set

Queue: java.util.queue
1. follows queue structure to add and retrieve data like how the queue work firstcome will first served
FIFO -> first in firstout

Map : java.util.map
1. stores data in key value format
2. doesn't extend or inherit the Collection interface
3. contains unique key
4. can have duplicate values



List Interface --> extended by ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector

ArrayList :  dynamic resizing --> when it reaches its threshold its resizes by 50%
2.not synchronized

LinkedList : implements list and Deque interface
2.maintains insertion order
3. non synchronized
4. can use ListIterator to iterate


Set Interface : HashSet and LinkedList are the classes  and one interface  SortedSet which implement by TreeSet

HashSet: it implecitly implements hashTable
contains only unique elements
Only one null can be added
its unordered set

LinkedHashSet
maintains insertion ordered set


Map interface : implements by HashMap and HashTable and extends to sorted map  which implemeted by Tree map

HashMap : non synchronizec, one null key and multiple null values
HashTable : its synchronized, doesn't allow null key and null values


The main reason Map doesn't extend collection interface : add metod not present where put present
Map follows key value pair where Collect follows object
